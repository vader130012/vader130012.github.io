        <p>Hello, friend? Maybe I should give you a name but that's wired as you're only in my head. We have to remember that. Darmn it's actually happened, I'm talking to an imaginary person.
          What I'm about to tell you, is about my average life. I know doesn't sound interseting, right. But you don't have to know me perosnally ( and you can't, even if you want to).
